The net stoichiometry for an individual reaction is again represented as a vector of Pairs, mapping species id to the net change in the species when the reaction occurs.\nscale_rates is an optional parameter that specifies whether the rate constants correspond to stochastic rate constants in the sense used by Gillespie, and hence need to be rescaled. The default, scale_rates=true, corresponds to rescaling the passed in rate constants. When using MassActionJump the default behavior is to assume rate constants correspond to stochastic rate constants in the sense used by Gillespie (J. Comp. Phys., 1976, 22 (4)). This means that for a reaction such as 2A oversetkrightarrow B, the jump rate function constructed by MassActionJump would be k*A*(A-1)/2!. For a trimolecular reaction like 3A oversetkrightarrow B the rate function would be k*A*(A-1)*(A-2)/3!.
